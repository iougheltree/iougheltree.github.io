            <p> My name is Isabelle Ougheltree. I am currently a junior at the University of Rhode Island. This Fall of 2020 is actually my first semester here at URI. For my first two<br> years of my college education, I attended the Community College of Rhode Island under the RI Promise scholarship. I am majoring in an applied math degree 
                with a minor<br>of general business. I am 20 years old and live in Little Compton, Rhode Island. I have lived in LC my whole life and love it. I am less than a five minute drive from the ocean and it has become my relaxation spot. </p>

               <p>When I am not in school or at work, I really enjoy watching the sunset and playing with my dog, Tuck, and my cat, Simba. Tuck is about 8 years old now and is a cavalier king charles. He is very playful and super friendly with other people as well as other animals. My cat, Simba, just turned one. He was a stray kitten and is the first and only family cat!</p>
